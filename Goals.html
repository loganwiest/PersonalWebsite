            <p class="intro"> Having the chance to work in a collaborative environment during the AEV project allowed me to take on roles that I am usually unfamilair with. Due to the high pace of the class, it was important to make sure everybody was on the same page so that tasks could run smoothly, so being a project manager was something I took seriously. Organizing team meetings, assigning work for teammates outside of class, and overseeing the design process were big parts of my role, but communicating was essential for having a successful project. In an industry moving rapidly every year, having strong leadership and communication skills allows for people to quickly adapt to the changes.

                In terms of motivation for learning new technical skills outside of the classroom, I have recently engaged in creating my own website from scratch. My main goal was that I wanted to expand my prior knowledge of HTML and CSS languages, while at the same time incorporating design concepts from a technical writing class I have recently taken. The final product is this website, and I wanted to focus on a minimalistic design that was attractive to the eye. This project also sparked interest in future aspirations for web development considering that I enjoyed the design process and I like the idea of people from all over the world having access to my work.

                I find computer science intriging because the environemnt is challenging, yet very rewarding at the same time. After talking to people that have been working STEM related jobs for 20+ years, they emphasize how their job teaches them something new every year due to new technological breakthroughs. Whether computers are impacting environmental or finacial analysis tasks, the applications of software is helping peoples lives daily. By being on the forefront of change working with computers, I can be motivtated to continue electronic innovation, knowing I am helping society become more efficient and less stressful.
